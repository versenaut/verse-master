This is a prototype for a Verse master server. The idea is that the master
server runs somewhere, and maintains a list of "live" Verse servers. This
list is kept up to date by having the ordinary Verse servers "ping" the
master server every once in a while. See the -master=IP option in the
Verse server code.

This is unreleased, a snapshot of something I did just to test the concept
and get a backend when implementing the initial support for master servers
in the server itself. Also, that was months ago, and I'm not up to speed
on the details at the moment, sorry.
