This is a reference implementation of a Verse master server.

The idea is that the master server runs somewhere, and maintains a list
of "live" Verse servers. This list is kept up to date by having the
ordinary Verse servers "ping" the master server every once in a while.
See the -ms:ip=IP option in the Verse server code.

See the Verse master server spec at 
<http://verse.blender.org/cms/Master_Server__v2.775.0.html> for more.
